 <h2 style="font-size:200%;">Interest in IT </h2>
 <p>I was very interested in writing programs, and I wanted to be a game maker in the future when I was very young. Since my first game as a child was Super Mario Bros, I became interested in how games were made. I choose RMIT University because it is a good school both in terms of geographical location and QS ranking. This is where I can make my dreams come true.

   <h style="font-size:140%;">Introduction</h>
   <p>Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often-ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.</P>

  <p>I am an Auditory learner<br>
If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.
As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.
Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.

 <h6 style="font-size:180%;">Project Idea</h6>

  <h style="font-size:140%;">Overview </h>
 <p>This is a smart phone app for health, which has many functions and other extension products. It can serve people of all ages and can even become an essential mobile app for humans. In addition to paying attention to users' health, the app can also be integrated into shopping platforms and payment platforms. However, this app will not be a huge application, but should be a small and versatile software.</p>
  <h style="font-size:140%;">Motivation</h>
     <p>Nowadays, health has become an unavoidable problem all over the world. With the development of diet, more and more obese people have a higher probability of getting sick because of obesity, which affects the average life span of human beings. If there is such a monitoring application can help them at the same time, again derivative more features. It's also great for profitability.</p>

 <h style="font-size:140%;">Description</h>
    <p>I want to develop a smartphone app. This app can help mankind to improve their lives, with other intelligent devices in the home to install smart cameras and worn, to realize intelligent device automatically collect data and uploaded to the cloud, and then after a big data analysis, people can see his own body on the mobile phone app status and how to improve their own bad situation. For example, when a user of this software orders a pizza for delivery, the smart camera will automatically scan and analyze the calories and ingredients of the pizza. If the user sets a daily calorie limit on the app, the smart assistant in the app will alert the user through the phone or other smart devices once the limit is exceeded. Other than that, think of it as an intelligent butler, like Jarvis in the Iron Man movie. While the current technology can't bring the app to life, soon more talented programmers will be able to develop more innovative updates to bring the app to life. However, there are also many defects. For example, hackers may invade home cameras or databases to steal the private information of APP users, to carry out some illegal activities. Of course, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, because once you build up a few users, you can start exploring other smart devices and more interesting features that you can sell and charge for. If once people like these can make you keep healthy app, they may recommend to more people, even friends can have a list, summary of week of healthy eating, exercise and sleep quality through database operations after given a score, I think if everyone start competing for higher health scores, this will be a good trend to benefit society and reduce the pressure on hospitals. Of course, this app can also set up family groups and share data to focus about others. For example, children studying abroad, or busy people can quickly care about people around them on the app. However, it is not only an app for collecting data, but also some games can be added to it, so that people can conduct efficient training anytime and anywhere. These games can also be challenged online, such as a push-up contest between two people from different countries. I also have a better idea that multi-element expansion can be introduced. For example, people in the financial industry can directly check their own stock market while doing exercise through the app, or Integrated into the shopping platform, people of all ages can use this app anytime and anywhere in their life. You can even add a QR code payment function to make the life app more useful in your daily life.</p>

<h style="font-size:140%;">Tools and Technologies</h>
    <p>The first step is to use a good programming tool, such as Java. You also need a team to work together to complete each section. For example, someone needs to be responsible for the development of the program, someone needs to test the bugs of the program, someone needs to make continuous updates to the security section of the program. I think it takes a lot of people a long time to develop perfect software</p>

<h style="font-size:140%;">Skills Required</h>
   <p>To complete this project, you need a lot of people who love the IT industry, and they need to have enough motivation for IT. Because you need to develop the hardware as well as the program. Numerous tests and failures are expected throughout the early stages of a development project, so the team also needs to have the spirit of never giving up.</p>

<h style="font-size:140%;">Outcome</h>
  <p>Once this project is successful. It should be as successful as Musk and Zuckerberg. Or at least become a rich celebrity. The contribution to society is also very significant. It may even help the development of human civilization. The future is very good.
